# Discord Chat Bot

The Discord Chat Bot is a NodeJS-powered chatbot utilizing DialoGPT-large and hosted for free on Repl.it for reliable 24/7 uptime. 

To add the bot to your server, simply paste the following URL into your browser: 

`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1053064397792223273&permissions=75776&scope=bot` 

Alternatively, you can click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1053064397792223273&permissions=75776&scope=bot) to invite the bot to your server. Once the bot is added, create a dedicated `bot-channel` and every message sent in this channel will be directed to the bot, which will respond with an appropriate reply.

TODO:
1. Restrict bot activity to a specific channel name or call.
2. Provide documentation on how to add the bot to servers.
3. Add more functionality to the bot.
4. Train the bot to improve its performance.
